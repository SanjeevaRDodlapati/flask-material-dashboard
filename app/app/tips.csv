Fish and shellfish
contain high quality protein and other essential nutrients, are low in
saturated fat, and contain omega-3 fatty acids. Women and young
children should include fish or shellfish in their diets due to the many
nutritional benefits. However, nearly all fish and shellfish contain traces of
mercury. For most people, the risk from mercury by eating fish and shellfish
is not a health concern. Yet, some fish and shellfish contain higher levels of
mercury that may harm an unborn baby or young child’s developing
nervous system. The risks from mercury in fish and shellfish depend on the
amount of fish and shellfish eaten and the levels of mercury in the fish and
shellfish.
Therefore, the FDA and the EPA are advising women, who may become
pregnant, pregnant women, nursing mothers and young children to avoid
some types of fish and eat fish and shellfish that are lower in mercury.","By following these 3 recommendations for selecting and eating fish or
shellfish, women and young children will receive the benefits of eating fish
and shellfish and be confident that they have reduced their exposure to
the harmful effects of mercury.
1) Do not eat shark, swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish because they all
contain high levels of mercury.
a) Eat up to 12 ounces (2 average meals) a week of a variety of fish
and shellfish that are lower in mercury.
2) Five of the most commonly eaten fish that are low in mercury are
shrimp, canned light tuna, salmon, pollock, and catfish.
a) Another commonly eaten fish, albacore “white” tuna has more
mercury than canned light tuna. So, when choosing your two meals
of fish and shellfish, you may eat up to 6 ounces (one average
meal) or albacore tuna per week.
3) Check local advisories about the safety of fish caught by family and
friends in your local lakes, rivers, and coastal areas.
a) If no advice is available, eat up to 6 ounces (one average meal)
per week of fish you catch from local waters, but don’t consume
any other fish during that week.
Follow these same recommendations when feeding fish and shellfish to
your young child, but serve smaller portions.
